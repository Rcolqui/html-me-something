                <p>We've all had those nights where we dread the thought of having to cook dinner, whether it's because
                    you had a long day or you simply don't feel like cooking. For most people getting take out is the
                    answer, but what if you're feeling burnt out on all your local take out options, or maybe you're
                    trying to save money by eating out less? Not to worry because listed below are a few easy to prepare
                    meals that are not only delicious but you probably have most of the ingredients already!</p>

                    easy to make in a multi-purpose pressure cooker for when you're short on time. Just pressure cook it
                    on high for 8
                    minutes plus 10 minutes natural release if your chicken breasts are thawed, or 14 minutes on high
                    plus 10 minutes natural release if your chicken breasts are frozen. At the end when you add your
                    sour cream/cream cheese, just set your pressure cooker to saute till heated through.

                <p>Korean Ground beef is the quick weeknight version of your favorite Korean restaurant. A plate of
                    sweet and spicy beef made easier with the use of ground beef instead of short ribs. From start to
                    finish, this recipe
                    takes
                    less than 30 minutes to make with a good chunk of that time being used for simmering. What makes
                    this recipe even better is you probably already have most of the ingredients for it on hand. Doesn't
                    get much easier right?

                <p>This is another slow cooker recipe and one of my favorites to boot. This recipe takes the popular
                    Vietnamese ba&#769;nh m&igrave; sandwich and turns it into a rice bowl. Being quick and easy to
                    prepare
                    along with the flavor combination of the savory pork, pickled carrots, shredded cabbage, and sliced
                    cucumbers, this is a recipe you don't want to miss out on!
                    <br><br>Recipe can be found here: <a

                        Bowls</a>
                    <br><br>Don't want to slow cook it? Not a problem! Cook the pork in a multi-purpose pressure cooker
                    to
                    have this
                    recipe ready in a fraction of the time. Just add all the pork ingredients to your pressure cooker
                    and
                    select the meat/stew function and set the time to "more". You'll have pork that's falling apart in
                    no
                    time! </p>
